		<p>
				I have played baseball since I was 7 years old and loved every minute of it. As I go to college I want<br>
				to be able to play baseball whether that is playing on the club team or any REC team that I can find, I<br>
				just want to be able to play. While at Chamois, the school got a team my last two years of highschool<br>
				while playing on the team everyone recongnized my as the best player and I was the team captain both<br>
				years. During my senior year I was considered the best player in the league that we played in by all the<br>
				coaches.
